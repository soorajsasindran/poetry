Twas brillig and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogoes
And the mome raths outgrabe

Beware the jabberwock my son
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch
Beware the jubjub bird and shun
The frumious bandersnatch

And on and on the poem went
But memory did fail him
And so he stopped his typing it
Old age it had impaled him
